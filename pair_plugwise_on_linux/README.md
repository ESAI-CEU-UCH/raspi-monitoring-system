# Pair Plugwise on Linux

This version pairs your Plugwise Circles and Circle+ on Linux.

This version is prepared to work with our monitoring system, so it loads the
data from our MongoDB server. Execute it as:

```
$ python pair_raspimon.py
```

## Original README content

For the moment, this version pairs sockets with identity "000D6F00003".
It works on firmwares 2008-03-10 (Circle+) and 2008-08-26 (USB stick).

### Cloning

go to a folder (for example /home/user/hackstuces) and run:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/hackstuces/PlugwiseOnLinux.git
$ cd PlugwiseOnLinux
```

### Configuring

run the command:

`apt-get install python-serial`

### Using

go to the folder PlugwiseOnLinux and run : 

`$ python pair_pol_v1.py`


### Notes

The pairing is done only when your sockets are initialized. To initialize,
connect your Circle during 3 seconds and then disconnect it during 3
seconds. Repeat it 3 times.

After, run the command:

`$ stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 ispeed 115200 ospeed 115200 cs8 -parenb`

During the pairing (choose m in the menu), the Circle+ have to turn off (during
few seconds) then turn on.
