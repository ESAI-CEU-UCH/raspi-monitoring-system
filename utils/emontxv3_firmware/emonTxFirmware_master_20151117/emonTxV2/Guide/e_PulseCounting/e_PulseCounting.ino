  Part 5 â€“ Pulse counting
  
  Many meters have pulse outputs, including electricity meters: single phase, 3-phase, 
  import, export.. Gas meters, Water flow meters etc

  The pulse output may be a flashing LED or a switching relay (usually solid state) or both.

  In the case of an electricity meter a pulse output corresponds to a certain amount of 
  energy passing through the meter (Kwhr/Wh). For single-phase domestic electricity meters
  (eg. Elster A100c) each pulse usually corresponds to 1 Wh (1000 pulses per kwh).  

  The code below detects the falling edge of each pulse and increment pulseCount
  
  It calculated the power by the calculating the time elapsed between pulses.
